## 🔒 Safety Features

### Collision Prevention System
The system implements multiple layers of safety:

1. **Pre-Schedule Validation**
   - Checks all planned movements for conflicts
   - Identifies potential collision points
   - Validates crossing arrangements

2. **Real-time Verification**
   - Double-checks block clearance before movement
   - Enforces safety holds if block occupied
   - Monitors headway continuously

3. **Event-based Alerts**
   - Critical: Collision risks
   - Warning: Insufficient headway
   - Info: Normal operations

## 📊 KPI Details
